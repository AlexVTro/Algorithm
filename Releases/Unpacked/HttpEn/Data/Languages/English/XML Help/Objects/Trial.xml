        <text>Using this object you can turn your program into a real ShareWare program. Its function is to <b>watch over</b> the trial period, activation, registration key and so on.</text>
      </p>
      <textAll>
        <p>
          <b>Trial</b> makes the registration of the program self-acting. You can find the example of how this object is used in <i>Examples\Complex projects\Trial</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The object gives no guarantee that your ShareWare program won't be hacked. Be aware that the hacker can do it easily.
          That's why we advise you to supplement the object Trial with your own methods of watching over the trial period and activation so that it would become complicated for the hacker to hack your program.

    <remarks>
      <text>
        Every object <b>Trial</b> is associated with your program <b>only</b> owing to the property
        <link2 file="Trial/PropertiesCommands/Id program.html">Id program</link2> (unique identifier of your program) and the property <link2 file="Trial/PropertiesCommands/Key encryption.html">Key encryption</link2> (contains the algorithm of encryption).
        So if you use several Trials and want them to work with the same keys and Id, then make sure that they have <b>identical</b><b> Id program</b> and <b>key encryption!</b>
