          <b>Complex operations wizard</b> is the most complex part of Algorithm environment, but it
          gives <b>lots of potentials</b> for developing a great variety of software solutions.

        <p>
          To open the wizard click a button with <b>a magic wand</b> on it. This button can be found to the right of text boxes (e.g. in <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html">Actions tab</link>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's learn the process of creating a complex action by the example of calculating how many years have gone from the year specified in the
          <link file="Objects/Text.html">text box</link>:
          <imgMy src="Master.jpg"></imgMy>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the string "Years have gone" is concatenated with the result of calculation, where the
          <link file="UsefulObjects/_Date/PropertiesCommands/Today.html">current year</link> is subtracted out of the year specified in the
          <link file="Objects/Text.html">text box</link> (Window1.Text1.Text).
          For example, if in the text box you input "2000" and today is 2009, then the result of the complex operation produced in the wizard is to be: "Years have gone: -9", that's because "2000" - "2009" is "-9".
          If we press the button <b>Ок</b>, then the wizard would give us <b>the result</b> of its work. This is a complex operation, in our case: <i>"Years have gone: " <![CDATA[&]]> (Absolute(Window1.Text1.Text) -
          _Useful objects._Date._Year(_Useful objects._Date._Today))</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's review each element of the wizard in details:
        </p>
        <p>
          <table>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td><text><b>1 - Wizard blocks</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    The wizard consists of <b>blocks</b> which help to compose complex operations.
                    The number of blocks is unlimited, you can <b>add</b> them by clicking button <b>2</b> and <b>delete</b> by clicking button <b>4</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each <b>block</b> have two states: a <b>simple</b> one - when particular data is input
                    (as in the first block on the shot) and a <b>complex</b> state - when one can choose properties of the object (the second and third blocks on the shot). You can switch between two states by clicking button <b>6</b>.
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><text><b>2 - Addition of a block</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    This button <b>adds</b> a new block in the place near the button.
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><text><b>3 - Parentheses  arrangement</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    Each block can be separated with parentheses. There are <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> parentheses, their number is <b>unlimited</b> and the number of left ones can differ from the number of right ones.
                    For example, if you need to create an action (("-2")+"3"), then in the first block (where 
                    the number "-2" is) you should specify two left parentheses and one right. And in the second block (where the number
                  "3" is) you should specify just one right parenthesis.
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><text><b>4 - Deletion of a block</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    This button <b>deletes</b> a block.
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><text><b>5 - Additional function</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    For each block you can use additional <b>function</b>. All additional
                    functions are <b>common mathematical</b>
                    operations - root, sine, cosine, rounding, changing sign. As for the shot, in the block 2 the function
                    <b>absolute</b> is used (this function makes a negative number positive in case something like 
                    "-2000" would be input).
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><text><b>6 - Change of block state</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    Each <b>block</b> have 2 states: a <b>simple</b> one - when particular data is input
                    (as in the first block on the shot) and a <b>complex</b> one - when one can choose properties of the object
                    (the second and third blocks of the shot). By clicking this button you'll <b>change</b> the block state from simple to complex.
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><text><b>7 - Blocks connection</b></text></td>
                <td><text>
                  <p>
                    All blocks are bound with a particular <b>type of connection</b>. Connection can be <b>mathematical</b>
                    (addition, division, concatenation) and <b>logical</b> (unequally, more, less, _AND, _OR).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the given example we have a <b>mathematical connection</b>, i.e. blocks are connected with some mathematical
                    operation. Here blocks 2 and 3 are <b>bound by subtraction</b> and the block 2 is a
                    <b>minuend</b> and the block 3 is a <b>subtrahend</b>. Between block 1 and the difference of blocks 2 and 3 there is  a
                    <b>plus</b>, which means that they are connected with <b>addition</b> and the result of the action is a <b>sum</b> 
                    of summands of <i> block 1</i> and <i>(block 2 - block 3)</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Apart from mathematical connection there is also a <b>logical</b> connection (equal, unequally, more, less or equal).
                    This type of connection is helpful in creating
                    <link file="Environment/IfPart.html">events</link> and
                    <link file="Environment/CyclePart.html">cycles</link>.
                    The result of condition is whether the condition is <b>true</b> or 
                    <b>false</b>. So if it is necessary to create an event, then logical operators are used
                    which definitely indicate <b>either "Yes"</b>, <b>or "No"</b>. 
                    For example, expression "2" &lt; "3" can be either a true condition,
                    or a false one. There are <b>no other variants</b>. In the example it's true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Besides, if the condition is <b>complex</b>, then special logical operations are used:
                    <b>_AND</b> and <b>_OR</b>. If two conditions are connected with <b>_AND</b>, then their mutual result would be "Yes" 
                    (i.e. taken together they would be a true condition) only if <b>both condtions are true</b>.
                    For example, if we need to confirm that the number specified in the text box is more than 5 and less than 10, then in the wizard it looks like this:
                  </p>
                  <p><imgMy src="Master2.jpg"></imgMy></p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly to this the mutual result of two conditions connected with <b>_OR</b> would be a true condition
                    <b>even if one of the condition is true</b>. So if you need to confirm that the number specified in the text box is less than 2 and more than 7, then in the wizard it looks like this:
                    <i>Window1.Window1.Text &lt; "2" _AND Window1.Text1.Text &gt; "7"</i>
                  </p>
                </text></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
