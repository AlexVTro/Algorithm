        The first, fundamental branches are <link file="Objects/Window.html">Windows</link>.
        These branches include all <link file="Objects.html">objects</link> of the given window.
        Then there are <link file="Environment/EventPart.html">Events</link> of each object. Events
        include in their turn all <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html">actions</link>,
        <link file="Environment/IfPart.html">conditions</link> and
        <link file="Environment/CyclePart.html">cycles</link>. 
        <link file="Environment/CommPart.html">Comments</link> can be located in any part of the actions tree.
      </p>

        You can easily relocate, copy, insert, delete all elements of the actions tree. Besides, you
        can <b>edit</b> them in two ways:<br/>
        1) Select a necessary action and edit it <b>in the text box</b> which is placed below the actions tree.<br/>
        2) Select a necessary action and click the right button of the mouse, then select menu item <b>Edit</b> (or simply click twice on the action). The action will appear in the <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html">actions panel</link> so you can edit it now.        
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides you can flag all actions with <b>checkpoints</b>:

        All information on checkpoints and flagging you can find in the section <link file="Programming/Debug.html">Project debugging</link>
