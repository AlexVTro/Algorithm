          <b>Cycles</b> are same <link file="Environment/IfPart.html">conditions</link> except for that
          all <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html">actions</link> inside of cycles are being executed constantly,
          <b>until the condition is false</b> (e.g. until the 
          <link file="Objects/Window/PropertiesCommands/Height.html">height of the window</link> is less than 100)
        </text>
      </p>
      <textAll>
        <p>
          You can <b>create a cycle</b> in the Cycles tab of
          <link file="Environment.html">Algorithm2 development environment</link>:
          <imgMy src="CyclePart.jpg"></imgMy>
        </p>
        <p>
          There you should specify the <b>condition of cycle itself</b> in the form of: "something" is equal/unequally to "something" 
          ("unequally" is specified by the symbol &lt;&gt;, "more or equal" - by the symbol &gt;=)
          <codesnip><![CDATA[Window1.Text1.Text = "Required text"
Window1.Window1.Width > "200"
Window1.Button1.Fore color  <> black
Window1.Window1.X >= Window1.Text1.Text]]></codesnip>
           After you have clicked the button <b>Create</b> cycle block appears in the 
          <link file="Environment/TreePart.html">Actions tree</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now all <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html">actions</link> inside of this cycle block  
          are being <b>constantly cyclically executed</b> until the cycle condition is false. In other respects 
          cycle conditions function the same way <link file="Environment/IfPart.html">standard conditions</link> function.

    <remarks>
      <text>Cycle conditions can be not only <b>simple</b> (texts or numbers comparison), but also <b>complex</b>
      (formula, comparing with a property value of the other object).
      To create a complex condition use
      <link file="Environment/Master.html">Complex operations wizard</link> (click on the button with a magic wand on it).
      <p>
        You can interrupt a cycle pre-term, without waiting for the rest of actions have been executed. Learn more about it in the section
