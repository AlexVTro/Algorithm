      This category contains all words which do not match any other category. There you can find <b>most commonly</b> used and useful words. For example, words "<b>Yes</b>" and "<b>No</b>" are used for a great number of properties, such as <b>Visible, Font bold, Enabled</b>, etc.
      The word "<b>Nothing</b>" is used everywhere where it is necessary to leave the property value empty. For example, to remove a <link file="Objects/Window/PropertiesCommands/Background image.html">background image</link> of the window it is necessary to specify this word ("Nothing") for this property.

      There all basic <b>colors</b> are collected. By equating one of quick fill words of this group (red, blue, yellow, etc.) with some color property (Back color, Fore color) you'll color the object in a way you need.

Window1.Button1.Fore color = brightBlue
Window1.Window1.Back color = "Red"]]></codesnip>
      Besides using quick fill words you can set the color in numbers. More details about this you'll find there:
