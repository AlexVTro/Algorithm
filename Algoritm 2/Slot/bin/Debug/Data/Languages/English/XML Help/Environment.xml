        <text><b>Development environment</b> is an application window, divided into several parts. Each part is
        designed for a particular <b>development stage</b>  (graphical interface designing, objects customizing, coding).</text>
      </p>

        <p>
          Scheme of the environment :
        </p>
        <imgMy src="Environment.jpg"></imgMy>
      <p>
        <childlist>
        </childlist>
      </p>
      <p>
        The program you are creating can be easily <b>run</b> and tested at any stage of the process. To run it select menu items <b>Project -> Run</b>. While running the project you can debug it: pause, flag checkpoints and so on. See more details in the section <link file="Programming/Debug.html">Project debugging</link>
      </p>
      <p>
        When the program is ready you can create *.exe-file of your program which could be run irrespective of the Algorithm development environment. To generate it select <b>File -> Compile Executable</b>. The generated file is your own program and you can do with it whatever you want: <b>share with friends, sell, distribute freeware</b> on the Internet.
