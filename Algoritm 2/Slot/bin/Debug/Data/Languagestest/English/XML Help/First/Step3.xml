      <textAll>It is time to explore <p><b> tool </b>, with which programs are <b> intelligent </b>. This tool - <b> conditions </b>. </p><p> In everyday life we constantly act on the basis of existing conditions . For example, I'll go for a walk in the evening <b> Terms </b> good weather. Or I'll buy this product <b> IF </b> its price is less  100 rubles. Similarly, on the basis <b> defined </b> environment, our program can choose what to do. </p><p> So, try to create the following condition: <b> IF </b> counted body mass index <b> Less than 20 </b>, then the inscription "LabelResult" write text <b> "You lack of weight "</b>. <b> AND IF </b> body mass index <b> more than 20 </b> and <b> less than 25 </b>, then the inscription "LabelResult" write text <b> "You have a normal weight" </b>. <b> AND IF </b><b> body mass index greater than 25 </b>, then withdraw <b> "You have obesity" </b>. </p><p><b> Good </b>, but since The inscription "LabelResult" we will use to display the text of the result (for example, "Do you lack the weight), then it would be better to keep Calculated BMI is not in this inscription, as we do now, but in a separate  place. In Algorithm 2, that place is a simple object - <link file="Objects/Memory.html"> Memory </link>. Create an object <b> memory </b>, click on it in <b> panel objects </b> (left). And ask her name <b> "MemoryBMI" </b>. </p><imgMy src="First9.jpg"></imgMy><p><b> Memory </b> knows only one thing - <b> store </b> what we say it in the property <link file="Objects/Memory/PropertiesCommands/Value.html"> value </link>. Let's change our complex action (<i> Window1.LabelResult.Tekst = Window1.TextWeight.Tekst \ Square (Window1.TextHeight.Tekst) </i>) so that BMI is not recorded in the text of a "LabelResult", but property <b> Value </b> Memory <b> "MemoryBMI" </b>. To do this, double click  on this action in the tree <b> Action </b> (it is in the center bottom), or click on this action <b> right </b>-click and select <b> "Edit" </b>. Now <b> section Action </b> (right), select instead "LabelResult" object <b> "MemoryBMI" </b> and the property <b> "Value" </b>. Click the button below <b> "Edit" </b>. </p><imgMy src="First10.jpg"></imgMy><p><b> Excellent! </b> Now when you click on the button, we will be charged BMI and recorded in the memory "MemoryBMI". Create finally condition which will <b> based </b> properties <b> Value </b> object <b> "MemoryBMI" </b> to determine your optimal weight. </p><p> conditions are created in <link file="Environment/IfPart.html"> under conditions </link> - this tab <b> "Terms" </b>, which is located in the tabs <b> right lower </b> corner. </p><p> Create a simple condition: <b> IF </b> counted body mass index <b> Less than 20 </b>. To do this, click on the button with the magic wand  and you will <link file="Environment/Master.html"> Master complex actions </link>. Select it <b> "Window1" </b>. <b> "MemoryBMI" </b>. <b> "Value" </b>. In the list of buttons with the little plus (middle), select <b> "! &lt; (If less)" </b>. And in the right pane, select the object, press a button with an arrow  up and type in the text box the number <b> "20" </b>. </p><imgMy src="First11.jpg"></imgMy><p> Click <b> "Create" </b> in the wizard complex actions, and then click <b> "Create" </b> under the conditions. <b> Congratulations </b>! You have created the condition. Now all the actions that we will place <b> inside </b> of the conditions are satisfied only if , if the condition is <b> true </b> (in this case, when the BMI is less than 20) . Click in the tree <b> Action </b> on are <b> condition </b>, go to the section <b> Action </b> (Actions tab on the right) and select the lists <b> "Window1" </b>. <b> "LabelResult" </b>. <b> "text" </b>, and in the text box, enter <b> "Do you lack the weight of" </b>. Click <b> "Create" </b>. </p><imgMy src="First12.jpg"></imgMy><p><b> Good </b>, now we have to create a more complex  condition. It will look to <b> BMI </b> was <b> more than 20 </b> but also <b> less than 25 </b>. Let's get started. Click on the newly created condition (<i> IF Window1.MemoryBMI.Znachenie &lt; "20" THEN </i>), go to the section <b> conditions </b> and select the item <b> " Create otherCase "</b>. <b> OtherCases </b> are the same conditions, but they will be checked only if the main condition <b> wrong </b> (in our case, the main condition is a BMI &lt; otherCases 20 and will be checked only if BMI will&gt; 20). </p><p> Click on the button <b> Wizard </b> action contrary <b> otherCases </b>. In the window that opens, select the value lists and text fields as <b> picture </b> below. </p><imgMy src="First13.jpg"></imgMy><p> Click <b> "Create" </b> in the wizard complex actions, and then click <b> "Create" </b> under the conditions. <b> Excellent </b>, have only to conclude the diagnosis. Click to <b> tree action </b> on are <b> podUsloviyu </b>, go to the section <b> Action </b> (Actions tab on the right) and select the lists <b> "Window1" </b>. <b> "LabelResult" </b>. <b> "text" </b>, and in the text box, enter <b> "Your weight is normal" </b>. Click <b> "Create" </b>. </p><p> now remains to consider only the question <b> obesity </b>. For him, could create the same <b> otherCase </b>, which would be written <b> "Window1" </b>. <b> "LabelResult" </b>. <b> "Text" </b>&gt; <b> "25" </b>. And you can do <b> easier </b>, with <b> third </b> section of <b> conditions </b> - <b> 'Create the section: "In all other cases,"' </b>. All activities are located in this section of the tree, take if <b> false </b> will <b> all </b> conditions (in our case it happens if BMI would be not less than 20 and not less than 25, ie if the BMI is&gt; 25). </p><p> Click on the newly created condition (<i> ELSEIF Window1.MemoryBMI.Znachenie &lt;= "20" _AND Window1.MemoryBMI.Znachenie &lt;= "25" THEN </i> ), go to the section <b> conditions </b> and select the item <b> 'Create the section: "In all other cases,"' </b>, Click <b> "Create" </b>. Then, create within the newly created partition action <b> 'Window1.LabelResult.Tekst = "You're obese"' </b></p><imgMy src="First14.jpg"></imgMy><p><b> Congratulations </b>! You have taken the course work in <link file="Environment.html"> IDE Algorithm 2 </link>, and now you can create <b> program </b>, which only <b> want </b>!
