          <b> Terms </b> allows you to specify whether to perform at the moment of action or not. The condition is a rule, usually <b> comparison </b> (for example, <link file="Objects/Window/PropertiesCommands/Text.html"> text box </link> is "Window1" or <link file="Objects/Button/PropertiesCommands/Width.html "> width button </link> above 100) and all <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html"> action </link> that come after this condition will be executed only when a <b> condition is true <i> O </i></b> (ie, <link file="Objects/Window/PropertiesCommands/Text.html"> text box </link> is really "Window1" a <link file="Objects/Button/PropertiesCommands/Width.html"> width button </link> above 100)</text>
      </p>
      <textAll>
        <p>
          <b> Create condition </b> You can go to the section conditions <link file="Environment.html"> Development Environments Algorithm 2 </link>: <imgMy src="IfPart.jpg"></imgMy></p>
        <p> It should introduce itself <b> condition in the form </b>: "Something" is equal/unequal "something" (unequal indicated &lt;&gt;, more or is marked &gt;=) <codesnip>Window1.Tekst1.Tekst = "introduced the text you want"
 Window1.Window1.Shirina&amp;gt; "200"
 Window1.Button1.Fore color &amp;lt;&amp;gt; black
 Window1.Window1.X&amp;gt; = Window1.Tekst1.Tekst</codesnip> Then click on the button <b> Create </b> will block conditions <link file="Environment/TreePart.html"> tree action </link>: </p>
        <p>
          <imgMy src="IfPart2.jpg">
          </imgMy>
        </p>
        <p> Now all <link file="Environment/ActionPart.html"> action </link> inside the block of conditions (in this case, there's only one effect: to make the window invisible) <b> executed only if </b>, if the text Window1 object is equal to "Window" </p>
        <p>
          <b> But is not all </b>. You can also create <b> otherCases </b> and the <b> In all other cases </b>. For their creation to <b> click </b> you've created on <b> usual condition </b> and go to section conditions. </p>

            <textAll>
              <p> Note: Symbol <b> _AND </b> is used as a symbol of what should be executed <b> both conditions </b> string: and "Window1.Window1.Vyshina&gt; 100" and "Window1.Window1.Vyshina &lt; 300. Along with <b> _AND </b> provides a symbol <b> _ANDLI </b>, which indicates that the condition is true, if it is true <b> At least one of the conditions </b>, ie or "Window1.Window1.Vyshina&gt; 100" or "Window1.Window1.Vyshina &lt; 300. That's all you can create a <link file="Environment/Master.html"> Wizard complex actions </link> (the button with the wand on the right) </p>
            </textAll>
          </codesnip2>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> otherCases: </b>
          <br /> They are checked in the event that the usual condition was <b> wrong </b>. If otherCase is correct, then it  action executed. If not, you will be viewed <b> following </b> otherCases. Created otherCases the same way as usual conditions. </p>
        <p>
          <b> In all other cases: </b>
          <br /> This section provides for cases where the condition and (if available) otherCases prove incorrect. All his actions will be executed only if the condition does not work. </p>

    <remarks>
      <text> conditions may be not only simple  (a comparison of the text, numbers) and <b> complex </b> (mathematical formula, the comparison with the value of the properties of another object). To create complex actions, use <link file="Environment/Master.html"> Master complex actions </link> (the button with the wand on the right) <p> Exit condition can be early, not waiting until then follow the remaining steps, more on this in <link file="UsefulObjects.html"> Useful sites </link>. <link file="UsefulObjects/_Interrupts.html"> Interrupts </link></p></text>
