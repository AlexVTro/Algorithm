      <textAll>
        <p> begin. When you run the development environment created <b> empty </b> project. <b> Save </b> it in some separate folder. Click <b> File -&gt; Save As </b>. Let's call the folder and project <b> "Calculation of the weight of" </b>. </p>
        <p> Now create the so-called user interface  program. This window, buttons, text boxes, text boxes, etc. In Algorithm 2, they are called <link file="Objects.html"> objects </link>. To create some <b> object </b> have to click on it in <link file="Environment/ObjectsPart.html"> panel objects </link>, which is located on the left . Create an object to start <link file="Objects/Button.html"> Button </link>, so that when they click on it your weight is calculated, and the results are displayed. </p>

        <p>
          <b> Appearance </b> This button can easily change , all settings <b> objects </b> (buttons, labels, windows) are in <b> right </b> of the window in <link file="Environment/PropertiesPart.html"> section properties </link> to <link file="Environment. html "> IDE Algorithm 2 </link>. This is a common table, where each <b> Properties </b> (color, text, width) corresponds to its value  (red, "ABVGD", 247). Changing <b> property values </b> you configure the object, in this case the button. </p>
        <p> So, let's change <b> text </b> button on <b> "Calculate" </b>. To do this, locate the section <b> properties </b> (right plate) property <link file="Objects/Button/PropertiesCommands/Text.html"> text </link>, and change its value with Knopka1 "to <b> "Calculate" </b>. </p>
        <p>
          <b> Very important </b> property is the property <link file="Objects/Button/PropertiesCommands/Name.html"> Name </link>. By <b> Name </b> we <b> contact </b> all <b> objects </b> in the program, so we point our button a meaningful name <b> "ButtonCalculate" </b>. To do this, locate the properties of Radel (plate on the right) property <b> Name </b>, and change its value with Knopka1 on <b> "ButtonCalculate" </b>. </p>
        <p> Excellent! The <b> ready </b>, could now be starting her program, but we need somewhere to learn <b> weight </b> and <b> growth </b> user. This is solved by using an object <link file="Objects/Text.html"> text box </link>. Create and place the two <b> text fields </b>. </p>
        <imgMy src="First2.jpg">
        </imgMy>
        <p> Erase <b> text </b> are <b> text fields </b>, and change <b> name </b> in the first field on <b> "TextWeight" </b>, and the latter on <b> "TextHeight" </b>. </p>
        <p> And <b> finally </b>, to complete the picture <b> create </b> objects <link file="Objects/Label.html"> Inscriptions </link>. <b> Two </b> of them put on <b> text fields </b>, in order to understand user  that they impose. <b> Names </b> they can ask any , and <b> text </b> as <b> picture </b> below. </p>
        <p>
          <b> third inscription </b> arrange the bottom of it, we got the result  (normal weight, or whether there is a problem). As <b> name </b> specify <b> "LabelResult" </b>. As a result, you should receive a similar window: </p>

        </imgMy>
        <p> If you prefer, you can run  are <b> program </b> and <b> look </b> how it works. This is done through the <b> Project </b> -&gt; <b> Run </b> or key <b> F5 </b>. If all goes well, then go to <link file="First/Step2.html"> next lesson </link>! <br /></p>
