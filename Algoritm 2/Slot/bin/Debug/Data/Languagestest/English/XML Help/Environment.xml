          <b> Development Environment </b> program of Algorithm 2 is a window divided into several parts. Each part is responsible for a certain <b> stage of development </b> program (the creation of graphical user interface, configuration objects, programming).</text>

        <p> program you can easily create a <b> start </b> and check how it works at any time. To do this, click the menu item <b> Draft -&gt; Run the program </b>. When you run the project, the program can be debugged: pause, set breakpoints, etc. More information about this topic <link file="Programming/Debug.html"> Debugging project </link></p>
        <p> When the program is complete, you can create a separate *. exe-file of your program to be run without the aid algorithm. To do this, select <b> File -&gt; Create a ready-made program </b>. Created file will be your own program and you can do with it what you want: <b> throw off your friends, sell, distribute freely </b> on the Internet. </p>
