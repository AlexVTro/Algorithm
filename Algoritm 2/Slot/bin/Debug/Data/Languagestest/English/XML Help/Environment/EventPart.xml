        <p>
          <b> Create Event </b> for an object, you can simply select it from the list of events, and then click Create. All of this is the section events <link file="Environment.html"> Development Environments Algorithm 2 </link></p>

    <remarks>
      <text> events are not only user actions (clicks, text input, resizing) and events occurring within objects. For example, <link file="Objects/Memory/Events/Changing value.html"> Change the value of memory cell </link>, <link file="Objects/Media/Events/On end.html"> end playing video file </link>, <link file="Objects/Stopwatch/Events/Tick.html"> Stopwatch tiknul </link>, etc. </text>
