        <text>For <b> dating </b> with the development environment Algorithm 2, let's create a simple project  "The calculation of weight." This program will calculate how much your optimal weight , depending on your <b> growth </b>. Work it will be as follows: the user enters a window, your weight and height, and on pressing the button the program displays the result.</text>

      <text>
        <p> project, which we will create here, lies in <b> Projects \ Examples \ Calculation of weight </b>. So do not necessarily do all the steps in the guide, but it is desirable, especially if you are a beginner in the development environment <b> algorithm </b>. </p>
        <p> This guide is also available as a video tutorial. View it from the menu <b> Help </b> -&gt; <b> video lesson </b>.
