          <b>Events</b> are actions performed by the user (clicking, cursor movement, etc.) which are connected with
          <link file="Objects.html">objects</link> (buttons, labels, windows). In <b>Events panel</b> you can assign objects those events which should be detected in the process of program work.

      <textAll>
        <p>
          <b>To assign</b> an object some <b>event</b> select the latter in the list of events, then click the button Create. 
          All these functions you can find in the Events panel of <link file="Environment.html">Algorithm2 development environment</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you <b>assign</b> the object <b>Button</b>the event <b>Click</b>, then all actions inside of this event are executed every time after the button has been clicked:
          <imgMy src="EventPart.jpg"></imgMy>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example after clicking on the button the text of the window title changes to "Window1".
        </p>
      </textAll>

    <remarks>
      <text>Events are not only the actions performed by the user (clicking, text typing, sizing), but also those inside of the objects. 
      For example, such events as <link file="Objects/Memory/Events/Changing value.html">memory cell value changing</link>, <link file="Objects/Media/Events/On end.html">video-file playing completion</link>,
      <link file="Objects/Stopwatch/Events/Tick.html">stopwatch ticking</link>, etc.</text>
    </remarks>
