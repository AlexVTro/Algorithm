          <b>Window</b> is a panel where you project graphic design of your program by placing  different <link file="Objects.html">objects</link> <b> in the area of the window panel</b> (buttons, text boxes, tables).
        </text>
      </p>
      <textAll>
        <p>
          <b>All objects</b> can be relocated in any way or brought to the front. You can also change sizes,
          <link file="Programming/Array.html">create arrays</link> and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of windows is unlimited. For convenience each new window occupies a separate tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some objects (memory cells, a stopwatch, print dialog) are located not in the window panel,
          but on the panel below. These are not graphical objects, but <b>software objects</b>.
          Such objects are hidden when the program works as they are designed for 
          <b>auxiliary operations</b> (e.g. data storage, time reckoning, printing)
